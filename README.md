# VIT-SoftwareDev

I have written a code to run the level 1 of PvE game in Main.java file.
Due to time contraints I was unable to debug this entirely and to develop this code futher to run level 1 and PvP games.
I have used Map interface in java collection framework to load the dataset given.
As I was unable to find any inbuilt function to score runs with given probability ,So ,I have written a code my self to do this task,
My approch to get this runs, with given probability was to randomly select a number from 1-100 and if number selected was less than the probablity(%), then I assumed the event to be succesfull.
It was quite challenging for me as I am from Mechanical background, but I tried my best in time I got .
